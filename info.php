					<h2>What To Bring</h2>
					<br />
					<p>
						<strong>Essential Things to Bring to Raindance.</strong> Belden Town is an intimate venue and will be FULL of shining happy people so while you will want to keep your camping on the minimalist side, there are a few clutch items you'll be thankful to have.  Some go without saying, like <strong>your wits and your smiles,</strong> though it never hurts to cover the bases!
					</p><br />
					<p>
						<strong>Shade</strong> - Every bit helps! It gets quiet sunny here in the California foothills.  Sunglasses, a sweet sun hat, a light scarf, wrap, parasol or sarong; shade is vital when the sun is high!  We will be spending a good deal of time at the river so be prepared for exposure.  The campgrounds are ringed with vibrant oaks and pines but there are open areas as well: don't count on getting a shady spot!  (You may want to bring some Aloe for hero points in case you or a friend over embrace the early-summer rays).
					</p><br />
					<p>
						<strong>Floaties</strong> - It's always a good time basking in bass while drifting along and there is no better way than on an inflatable inner tube or chaise lounge or shark.  Be it a personal pool-toy or an island oasis to share, come prepared to kick back with the flotilla of fun!
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						<strong>Clothing and costumery for all weather</strong> - It's a good idea to bring some warm nighttime clothes as well as 'non-clothes' for fun in the daytime sun.  Though it's usually quite warm this time of year in Belden, with all the crazy weather we've seen lately you just never know for sure.  Don't forget, music goes 24/7 and it's always coldest right before dawn!
					</p><br />
					<p>
						<strong>Food</strong> - Belden Town has a restaurant and Convergence will be serving delicious, nutritious hot meals, hooray!  As well, coffee will be sold by Cafe Mekka and Smoothie Operators will be whipping up cool tasty treats for us.  That said it is always a good idea to bring a few snacks to keep you going.  You may bring a small camp-stove, so long as it's not a full on BBQ grill.  No charcoal grills or open flames are allowed.
					</p><br />
					<p>
						<strong>Comfortable footwear and clean socks</strong> - This event is based on movement!  The grounds are small but you can dance for miles without ever leaving the dancefloor.  Your favorite <strong>shoes, boots and/or sandals are key.</strong> The terrain can be a little rocky and uneven in places. It all starts from the ground up, take care of your feet!  Again, the river: it moves along its' merry way so you may want to bring sandals with straps or shoes that are made for water action.  And be sure to have a dry pair of shoes for nighttime; who likes dancing all night in cold, soggy kicks??   -(don't even answer that)
					</p><br />
					<p>
						<strong>Water Containers</strong> - There is delicious fresh mountain water available on site near the stages so bring a refillable non-glass container to minimize waste.  Be sure to have a container for water for your campsite as it could be a bit of a stroll if you wake up thirsty.
					</p><br />
					<p>
						<strong>Lighting</strong> - There will be a waxing 3/4 moon, light sculptures and ambient path lighting to help keep you on track but it's a good idea to bring a headlamp or flashlight to help you keep it all together when the sun goes down.
					</p><br />
					<p>
						<strong>Recycling and rubbish bags</strong> - This is a <strong>LEAVE NO TRACE</strong> event.  Please try to not bring disposable items!  Minimize unnecessary packaging well beforehand and do not bring it on-site.  Let's look out for our impact on each other and the land, leaving everything better than we found it. Bring bags for your camp area, we will be recycling and it will be much easier if it is separated ahead of time!
					</p><br />
					<p>
						<strong>Tent</strong> - A basic necessity of most any outdoor overnight adventure is a tent to crash in.  Resurrect your inner scout with a basic set-up or Glamp it on up; either way, you'll be thankful to have a comfortable home base to come back to when you need to take a bit of rest.
					</p><br />
					<p>
						<strong>Bedding</strong> - You should plan to sleep at some point and will be thankful that you brought something comfortable to sleep in/on. If you prefer a hammock there are a few trees that could be utilized though often nothing beats a sleeping bag on a nice soft pad. Curl up inside when it's cooler at night and roll out on top of it when things warm up in the morning.  Make it possible to treat yourself kindly!!
					</p><br />
					<p>
						<strong>T.P.</strong> - Yes, there will be stocked and cleaned porta-potties but we've all been there when the luck runs out.  Don't get caught with your pants down!  Even one spare roll goes a long way, you will thank yourself for bringing this clutch item.

					<h2>Leave No Trace</h2>
					<p style="text-indent: 0;">
						Please take a few moments to minimize what you are bringing into the venue.  Remove all unnecessary packaging you may have acquired before you come.  We will be recycling discarded items and it would be very helpful if we all bring bags to keep our recycling separated from rubbish.  Most importantly, no matter whose it is, if it's out of place <strong>PICK IT UP!</strong>  Let's keep this venue beautiful and clean while we enjoy its splendor and <strong>LEAVE IT BETTER THAN WE FOUND IT!!</strong>
